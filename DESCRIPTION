Description: PIT telemetry produces very large quantities of data that are
    difficult to manage in raw format. The PITR package is designed to automate and
    standardize the process of collating, managing and summarizing PIT telemetry
    data. During data collation, users can choose to export metadata to a working
    directory to assist in reviewing the analysis process. PITR functions allow
    users to: (1) collate data from multiple readers and filter out tags specific to
    a study; (2) restructure the configuration of readers and antennas into arrays;
    (3) compute the detection efficiency of individual antennas; (4) compute the
    direction of movement if there were two or more antennas deployed in a study;
    (5) summarize upstream and downstream movements for each fish on each array;
    (6) summarize the first and last detections on each antenna; and (7) plot the
    voltage of each reader over the study duration. Users can summarize data by
    year, month, week, day and hour. Notably, the quality of the data summaries is
    reliant on antenna performance.
