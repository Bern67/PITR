\title{Computes the detection efficiency of individual antennas}
\usage{
det_eff(dat, resolution = NULL, direction, start_date = min(dat$date_time),
  end_date = max(dat$date_time))
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{telemetry dataset created using old_pit, new_pit or array_config}

\item{resolution}{summarize data by year, month, week, day or hour}

\item{direction}{user-specified direction of fish movement}

\item{start_date}{start date of period of interest, default is first date in dataset}

\item{end_date}{end date of period of interest, default is last date in dataset}
}
\description{
Function that computes the detection efficiency of individual antennas based on the array configuration and the userâ€™s assumption of the direction of fish movement (up, down or resident). Data can be summarized by year, month, week, day or hour.
}
\details{
Users can apply the det_eff function to the original dataset created by the pit_data function, or use the updated dataset created by the array_config function. Arguments start_date and end_date, if specified, must be entered as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.
}
\examples{
#compute by month for fish assumed to be moving upstream
det_eff(new$all_det, "month", "up")

#compute by week for fish assumed to be moving upstream with a start date of 2015-10-11 08:45:00
det_eff(new$all_det, "week", "up", start_date = "2015-10-11 08:45:00")

#compute by day for fish assumed to be moving downstream
det_eff(new$all_det, "day", "down")

#compare by month for fish assumed to be resident
det_eff(new$all_det, "month", "resident")
}
